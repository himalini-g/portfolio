Statement: this is a generative, looping animation/
Each GIF is the same algorithim with different parameters. I wrote 
this algorithm from scratch in Processing using a combination of
metaballs and vector fields. Each hairy blob is a metaball, which 
is a gravity simulation that produces the effect of the hairy 
balls glop and unglop like a lava lamp. To produce the hairy 
surface I use a vector field on top of the metaballs. I then 
fine tuned the algorithmâ€™s parameters to give myself handles to 
produce varying animations.`
